# BoxImpact

## Set up
- [tested on linux systems only] Create a local host with:
```shell
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```
- [tested on firefox and chrome] Go to the project's page:
http://localhost:8080/.../BoxImpact/
Where `...`represents the path from the home folder `~/` to the cloned repository. For instance, if I cloned the project under `/home/user/GitProjects/`, the link will be
http://localhost:8080/GitProjects/BoxImpact/

## Usage
You can of course use your own email address, but if you would prefer, I created this email address for testing purposes:
> email: *myboximpact@gmail.com*<br></br>
> pwd: *FacteurCheval*
